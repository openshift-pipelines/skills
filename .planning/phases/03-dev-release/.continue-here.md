<current_state>
PR #14352 (Go builder v1.23 → v1.25) is open and awaiting team approval. The PR build pipelines passed but Enterprise Contract failed due to pre-existing Snyk SAST false positives. This has been investigated and documented as ISS-006.

Waiting on PR merge to proceed with dev release to QE.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Investigated PR #14352 EC failures in depth
- Determined root cause: Snyk SAST false positives (15 "hardcoded credentials" that are actually just K8s Secret names and env var keys)
- Ran gosec locally to confirm findings (21 issues, mostly G101 false positives)
- Documented ISS-006 with full analysis and fix options
- Updated issue priority: **STAGE RELEASE BLOCKER** (must fix before Phase 4)
- Prepared team communication explaining EC failures are safe to ignore for PR merge
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
1. **Get PR #14352 merged** — needs `lgtm` + `approved` labels from team
2. **Monitor on-push builds** — operator/proxy/webhook will rebuild after merge
3. **Copy images to dev registry** — quay.io/openshift-pipeline
4. **Test deployment on OCP 4.18** — cluster available at api.e8yd8-jboom-ft5.xazm.p3.openshiftapps.com
5. **Generate QE handoff**
6. **Fix ISS-006** — must complete before stage release (Phase 4)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- PR #14352 EC failures are pre-existing false positives, not new issues from the PR
- Snyk flags K8s Secret names like `"tekton-results-postgres"` as "hardcoded credentials"
- ISS-006 is a STAGE RELEASE BLOCKER — must fix before Phase 4, but can proceed with dev release first
- Fix options: (1) Add #nosec comments upstream, (2) KFP repo exclusions, (3) IGNORE_FILE_PATHS in pipeline
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
**PR #14352 needs team approval:**
- State: OPEN
- Reviews: None
- Labels: None (needs `lgtm` + `approved`)
- EC failures can be ignored — team communication prepared

**ISS-006 blocks Stage Release:**
- Must fix Snyk false positives before Phase 4
- Does NOT block dev release to QE
</blockers>

<context>
The Go 1.25 builder update (PR #14352) is required because upstream sync (PR #14238) brought Go 1.25.0 requirement. The PR only changes Dockerfile builder versions — no source code changes.

EC fails on all operator/proxy/webhook PRs due to Snyk SAST flagging string constants that contain words like "secret", "password", "credentials". These are Kubernetes resource names, not actual credentials.

Sequencing:
1. PR #14352 merge → unblock builds
2. Dev release → QE unblocked
3. Fix ISS-006 → stage release unblocked
4. Stage release (Phase 4)
5. Production release (Phase 5)
</context>

<next_action>
1. Check if PR #14352 has been approved/merged: `gh pr view 14352 --repo openshift-pipelines/operator`
2. If merged: Monitor on-push builds with `gh pr checks` or Konflux
3. If not merged: Follow up with team on approval
4. Once builds pass: Continue with dev release (copy images, test deployment)
</next_action>
