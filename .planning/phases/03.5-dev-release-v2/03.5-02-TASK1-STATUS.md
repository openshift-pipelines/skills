### Analysis

The nudge PR #14401 was created **7 minutes after** the FIPS fix merge but contains the **OLD SHA** (`01381d3...`).

This indicates:
1. The nudge was triggered by an EARLIER build (from the `70688711b21d` Konflux rebuild trigger commit on Jan 19)
2. The Konflux build triggered by PR #1540 merge has NOT completed yet
3. No NEW nudge PR exists for the FIPS-fixed nop image

## Current State in project.yaml

```yaml
value: quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/tekton-ecosystem-tenant/1-15/pipeline-nop-rhel8@sha256:01381d3d77e9eef98b85fbbbae45a0355c0aec5ee86abaa79476e0d20062c4ea
```

**This is the PRE-FIPS-fix SHA.**

## Expected Timeline

- Konflux multi-arch builds typically take 30-60 minutes
- Time since merge: ~1 hour 12 minutes
- Expected: New nudge PR should appear within next 30-60 minutes

## Status

**Pipeline status:** BUILDING (not completed)
**New SHA available:** NO
**Verification:** BLOCKED - waiting for Konflux rebuild to complete

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Konflux rebuild to complete
2. Watch for new nudge PR in operator repo
3. Once nudge PR appears, verify new SHA is different from `01381d3...`
4. Proceed to Plan 03.5-03 after human verification
