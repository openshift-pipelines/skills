## Technical Details

- Original commit: `2bb10e0fa71a3c91f79472eb6315ebf142ca57cc` (release-v1.20.x)
- Cherry-picked as: `8800fba5` (cherry-pick-fips-1.15 branch)
- Merge commit: `ad8982f1db020880b3376c88ea058d4f82b24f12` (release-v1.15.x)

**Changes applied:**
- FIPS_BUILDER stage added to nop.Dockerfile

- OS release file copied for FIPS certification
- CPE label correctly shows `1.15::el8`

**Conflict resolution:**
- Minor conflict in CPE label line
- Kept `1.15::el8` (appropriate for release-v1.15.x vs `1.20::el9` in source)

## Issues Encountered

None — cherry-pick was clean with minor conflict easily resolved.

## Next Steps

1. Wait for tektoncd-pipeline Konflux on-push build to complete
