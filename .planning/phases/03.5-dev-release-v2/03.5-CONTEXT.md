# Phase 3.5: Dev Release v2 - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Re-execute dev release with FIPS fix and add CPE/name labels to Dockerfiles. Provide fresh images to QE for validation before stage release.

**New requirement added:** `enforceContainerFirstSecurityLabels: true` will be enabled in Konflux release data — Dockerfiles must have correct `name` and `cpe` labels or stage/prod release will fail.

## Implementation Decisions

### CPE/Name Label Fixes
- Audit all 11 components to identify which Dockerfiles are missing labels
- Fix directly on release-v1.15.x branch (not main first)
- Look up correct CPE format from other release branches that already have it
- Verification: Konflux rebuild passes (no need to inspect labels or test EC policy)

### Image Scope
- Incremental approach: Copy only changed components first
- Verify the changed images work
- Decide if full refresh needed based on results

### Dev Release Workflow
- Manually trigger operator-update-images workflow (don't wait for Konflux nudges)
- Copy fresh images to quay.io/openshift-pipeline dev registry

### QE Handoff
- Add new "v2" section to QE-HANDOFF.md
- Show diff from v1 (what changed: FIPS fix, label additions)
- Include new image SHAs

### Claude's Discretion
- Order of label fixes across components
- Exact wording in QE handoff document
- Whether to batch PRs or create separate PRs per component

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Ralph Bean confirmed: If labels are missing, stage/prod release will fail
- MRs !13380 and !13381 adding `enforceContainerFirstSecurityLabels: true` will merge in February
- Divyanshu asked to fix labels for 1.15.x since stage release hasn't happened yet
- CPE format example from Slack: `cpe:/a:redhat:openstack:18.0::el9` (need to find OSP equivalent)
