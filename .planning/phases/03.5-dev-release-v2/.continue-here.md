<current_state>
Executing Phase 3.5: Dev Release v2. Plan 1 complete, Plan 2 at checkpoint waiting for Konflux FIPS rebuild. User requested adding Plan 03.5-04 for OCP version support changes before pausing.

**Wave 1 status:**
- Plan 03.5-01 (CPE labels): ✓ COMPLETE
- Plan 03.5-02 (FIPS monitor): CHECKPOINT - Konflux rebuild still in progress

**Wave 2 blocked on Wave 1 completion.**
</current_state>

<completed_work>

## Plan 03.5-01: Add CPE Labels to Dockerfiles ✓

- **pac-downstream**: Already had CPE labels (research was outdated) - no changes needed
- **p12n-manual-approval-gate**: PR #44 merged with CPE labels for controller + webhook Dockerfiles
- **Bonus**: Merged PR #38 for Konflux v1.15.x pipeline configs (required for on-push to trigger)
- Summary: `.planning/phases/03.5-dev-release-v2/03.5-01-SUMMARY.md`

## Plan 03.5-02: Monitor FIPS Rebuild - Task 1 only

- Checked Konflux pipeline status
- Found nudge PR #14401 but it contains OLD SHA (from pre-FIPS build on Jan 19)
- FIPS fix merged 2026-01-22T16:24:26Z (PR #1540)
- Konflux rebuild triggered but NOT YET COMPLETE
- Status file: `.planning/phases/03.5-dev-release-v2/03.5-02-TASK1-STATUS.md`
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Plan 03.5-02: Monitor FIPS Rebuild (CHECKPOINT)

- Task 2: Human verify checkpoint - waiting for Konflux to complete rebuild
- **Check for**: New nudge PR with SHA different from `01381d3d77e9eef98b85fbbbae45a0355c0aec5ee86abaa79476e0d20062c4ea`
- Commands to check:
  ```bash
  gh pr list --repo openshift-pipelines/operator --search "tektoncd-pipeline-1-15-nop" --state all --limit 5
  gh api "repos/openshift-pipelines/operator/contents/project.yaml?ref=release-v1.15.x" --jq '.content' | base64 -d | grep "pipeline-nop-rhel8"
  ```

## Plan 03.5-03: Copy Images and Update QE Handoff

- Task 1: Trigger operator-update-images workflow
- Task 2: Copy changed images to dev registry
- Task 3: Update QE-HANDOFF.md with v2 section
- Task 4: Human verify checkpoint

## Plan 03.5-04: OCP Version Support (TO BE CREATED)

User requested adding this plan. Research completed:

**OCP versions to REMOVE (EOL):**
- 4.12 (EOL Jan 17, 2025)
- 4.14 (EOL Oct 31, 2025)
- 4.15 (EOL Aug 27, 2025)

**OCP versions to ADD:**
- 4.19 (supported until Dec 17, 2026)
- Possibly 4.20

**Keep:** 4.16, 4.17, 4.18

Hack branches exist: `hack/openshift-pipelines-index-4.19/release-v1.15.x` and `hack/openshift-pipelines-index-4.20/release-v1.15.x`

Files affected per OCP version:
- application-index-4.XX.yaml
- component-index-4.XX.yaml
- image-index-4.XX.yaml
- release-plan-4-XX.yaml
- tests-index-4-XX.yaml
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

1. **pac-downstream CPE labels already done** - Research from 03.5-RESEARCH.md was outdated; the Dockerfiles already had CPE labels
2. **Merged PR #38 for Konflux configs** - Required for v1.15.x on-push pipelines to trigger properly
3. **Create Plan 03.5-04 for OCP versions** - User chose to add OCP version support changes to Phase 3.5 rather than deferring to Phase 4
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

1. **Konflux FIPS rebuild in progress** - Need to wait for tektoncd-pipeline Konflux build to complete before Plan 03.5-03 can proceed
   - Expected: 30-60 min for multi-arch build
   - Merged at: 2026-01-22T16:24:26Z
   - Should be done by now - check for new nudge PR

2. **Plan 03.5-04 not yet created** - Need to create plan for OCP version changes before executing
</blockers>

<context>
**Mental state:** Phase 3.5 execution was interrupted by user request to add OCP version support scope. The FIPS rebuild should be complete by now (over an hour since merge). The key insight from Plan 03.5-01 execution was that pac-downstream already had CPE labels - the research was stale.

**OCP Version Research Summary:**
- Current 1.15.x supports: 4.12, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17, 4.18
- Should support: 4.16, 4.17, 4.18, 4.19 (possibly 4.20)
- EOL to remove: 4.12, 4.14, 4.15
- Hack branches exist for 4.19/4.20 on release-v1.15.x

**Wave structure:**
- Wave 1: Plans 01, 02 (parallel) - 01 done, 02 at checkpoint
- Wave 2: Plan 03 (depends on Wave 1)
- Wave 3: Plan 04 (new, OCP versions)

**Test Cluster:** OCP 4.18.30 (api.zjdmf-xyift-oaz.6ccc.p3.openshiftapps.com)
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:resume-work`. First actions:

1. **Check if FIPS rebuild complete:**
   ```bash
   gh pr list --repo openshift-pipelines/operator --search "nudge" --state open --limit 10
   ```

2. **If complete:** Type "confirmed" to proceed past 03.5-02 checkpoint

3. **Create Plan 03.5-04** for OCP version changes:
   - Remove 4.12, 4.14, 4.15 index configurations
   - Add 4.19 (merge hack branch or create configs)
   - Update ROADMAP.md to reflect new plan

4. **Continue Wave 2** (Plan 03.5-03) once Wave 1 checkpoint cleared
