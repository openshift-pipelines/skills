<current_state>
Investigating PR #14184 (ubi8 update) pipeline failures. Discovered the root cause is NOT the ubi8 update itself, but a **wrong upstream sync** that was merged (PR #14238) which brought in Go 1.25.0 requirement while builder images only have Go 1.23.

The builds fail with: `go: go.mod requires go >= 1.25.0 (running go 1.23.10; GOTOOLCHAIN=local)`
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Closed ISS-005 in ISSUES.md (was already fixed)
- Addressed ISS-004: Added registry documentation to stage-release.md and prod-release.md
- Created new /osp:registry-info skill with comprehensive registry flow documentation
- All deferred issues now closed
- Investigated PR #14184 pipeline failures
- Identified root cause: PR #14238 synced from wrong upstream branch
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Immediate blocker to resolve:**
- Decide how to fix PR #14238 wrong upstream sync (revert or re-sync from correct branch)
- PR #14238 synced from `release-v0.71.x` (Go 1.25.0) instead of `release-v0.73.x` (Go 1.22.5)

**After fixing upstream sync:**
1. PR #14184 (ubi8 update) should then be able to build
2. Merge ubi8 update and trigger component rebuilds
3. Copy index images to dev registry
4. Copy component images to dev registry
5. Test deployment on OCP 4.18 cluster
6. Generate QE handoff
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- ISS-004 resolved by adding registry documentation to existing skills + new /osp:registry-info skill
- Root cause of PR #14184 failures is NOT the ubi8 update but the wrong upstream sync (PR #14238)
- The webhook/operator/proxy builds fail because go.mod requires Go 1.25.0 but builder image has Go 1.23.10
</decisions_made>

**CRITICAL: Wrong upstream sync merged (PR #14238)**
- Merged: 2026-01-19 by waveywaves
- Issue: Synced from `release-v0.71.x` (has Go 1.25.0) instead of `release-v0.73.x` (has Go 1.22.5)
- Impact: All operator/proxy/webhook builds fail on release-v1.15.x branch
- Options:
  1. Revert PR #14238 to restore Go 1.21
  2. Create fresh sync from correct upstream branch (release-v0.73.x)

**Question pending:** Was this intentional? Need to verify with team if 1.15.x should track v0.71.x or v0.73.x upstream.
</blockers>

<context>
The investigation started by checking PR #14184 (Konflux nudge PR for ubi8 base image update). Found pipelines were "in_progress" but actually stuck/failing. Dug into the webhook build logs and found the Go version mismatch error.

Traced back to discover PR #14238 (bot upstream sync) was merged on Jan 19 and brought in go.mod with `go 1.25.0` requirement. The commit `ad992695` that was synced is on `release-v0.71.x` branch, but based on Go versions, 1.15.x should probably track `release-v0.73.x` which has `go 1.22.5`.

Key data points:
- Before PR #14238: go.mod had `go 1.21`
- After PR #14238: go.mod has `go 1.25.0`
- Upstream release-v0.73.x: `go 1.22.5`
- Upstream release-v0.71.x: `go 1.25.0` (where ad992695 lives)

This needs team input to confirm whether to revert or if the sync was intentional.

<next_action>
1. Confirm with team: Should 1.15.x track release-v0.71.x or release-v0.73.x upstream?
2. If wrong sync confirmed:
   - Option A: Revert PR #14238
   - Option B: Create new sync from release-v0.73.x
3. After fixing, PR #14184 pipelines should pass
4. Then proceed with ubi8 merge and dev release testing
