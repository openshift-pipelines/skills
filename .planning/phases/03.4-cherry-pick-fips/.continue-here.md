Phase 3.4 just created. Need to cherry-pick FIPS nop.Dockerfile fix from release-v1.20.x to release-v1.15.x in openshift-pipelines/tektoncd-pipeline repo.

**Position:** Phase 3.4 ready to execute
**Plans:** 1 plan (03.4-01: Cherry-pick commit and create PR)
**Execution:** Not yet started

This phase was inserted because the FIPS fix is required before stage release.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
This session (2026-01-22):
- Analyzed EC verification log from `/Users/vibhavbobade/Downloads/openshift-pipelines-oper83d06be26d61d07f748ff48ee3124210-verify.log`
- Discovered NEW blocker: CVE-2025-59375 (libexpat in UBI8 base image) - HIGH severity
- Downgraded ISS-006 (Snyk SAST) from blocker to warning-only (doesn't fail EC)
- Closed ISS-007 (missing dev images - already fixed in Phase 3.2)
- Created ISS-008 for CVE-2025-59375
- Cancelled Phase 3.3 (Snyk SAST no longer needed)
- Created Phase 3.4 for FIPS cherry-pick task
- Updated STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, ISSUES.md with new understanding
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Phase 3.4 — Cherry-pick FIPS Fix:**

1. Clone/fetch openshift-pipelines/tektoncd-pipeline repo
2. Create branch from `release-v1.15.x`
3. Cherry-pick commit `2bb10e0fa71a3c91f79472eb6315ebf142ca57cc` ("Update nop.Dockerfile for fips")
4. Push branch and create PR targeting `release-v1.15.x`
5. Wait for PR merge and Konflux rebuild

**After Phase 3.4 — Before Stage Release:**

- Wait for CVE-2025-59375 fix (UBI8 base image with libexpat >= 2.7.2)
- Options: Wait for Red Hat UBI8 update OR request EC policy exclusion
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- ISS-006 (Snyk SAST) downgraded: EC verification logs show it's an "informative test" producing warnings only, not violations
- ISS-008 created: CVE-2025-59375 is the actual EC blocker (HIGH severity, libexpat in UBI8)
- Phase 3.3 cancelled: No longer needed since Snyk SAST doesn't block EC
- Phase 3.4 inserted: FIPS fix required before stage release per user request
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- **CVE-2025-59375 (libexpat):** HIGH severity CVE in UBI8 base image blocks EC verification for ALL operator image architectures. Fix requires libexpat >= 2.7.2 in base image. This is a Red Hat base image issue, not something we can fix in code.
  - Options: (1) Wait for UBI8 update (2) Request EC policy exclusion
</blockers>

<context>
**Key insight from log analysis:**
The EC verification failure we thought was caused by Snyk SAST (ISS-006) is actually caused by CVE-2025-59375. Snyk SAST findings are classified as "informative tests" which only produce warnings. The actual `cve.cve_blockers` violation is from the libexpat CVE in the UBI8 base image.

**Cherry-pick details:**
- Repo: openshift-pipelines/tektoncd-pipeline

- Message: "Update nop.Dockerfile for fips"
- Source branch: release-v1.20.x (commit is HEAD here)
- Target branch: release-v1.15.x

**Stage release path:**
1. Complete Phase 3.4 (cherry-pick FIPS fix)
