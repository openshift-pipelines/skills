<current_state>
Phase 3 (Dev Release) is COMPLETE. OpenShift Pipelines 1.15.4 has been deployed and verified on OCP 4.18.30.

Phase 4 (Stage Release) is BLOCKED by ISS-006 (Snyk SAST false positives causing EC failures).
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**Phase 3 Complete:**
- Plan 03-01: Index images copied to dev registry (5 OCP versions)
- Plan 03-02: Component images copied (28 images to quay.io/openshift-pipeline)
- Deployment verified on OCP 4.18.30 cluster
- TektonConfig Ready, version 1.15.4
- All 14 component pods running
- TaskRun execution successful
- QE handoff document generated: `.planning/phases/03-dev-release/QE-HANDOFF.md`
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Before Phase 4 can start:**
1. Fix ISS-006: Snyk SAST false positives (BLOCKER)
   - Options: Add `#nosec G101` comments upstream, or add exclusions to KFP repo
   - See `.planning/ISSUES.md` for full details

**Phase 4 Tasks (after blocker resolved):**
1. Execute stage release using /osp:stage-release
   - CORE components first
   - CLI next
   - OPERATOR bundle
   - INDEX images (all 5 OCP versions)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- **Used existing bundle** for dev release — bundle was built before Go 1.25 update, but CVE fixes are included in component images
- **ISS-006 deferred** — Snyk false positives don't block dev release (EC failures don't block GitHub merge), but must fix before stage
- **Copied bundle-referenced images** — Used the exact digests the bundle CSV references, not the newer nudge digests
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- **ISS-006: Snyk SAST false positives** (HIGH severity)
  - Affects: operator, proxy, webhook PRs
  - Root cause: Snyk flags Kubernetes Secret resource names as "hardcoded credentials"
  - Impact: EC checks fail on PRs, but GitHub merge still works
  - Must fix BEFORE stage release (Phase 4)
  - Fix options documented in `.planning/ISSUES.md`
</blockers>

<context>
The 1.15.4 dev release is ready for QE testing. The cluster (api.zjdmf-xyift-oaz.6ccc.p3.openshiftapps.com) has OpenShift Pipelines 1.15.4 installed from the dev index.

Key artifacts:
- Index images: quay.io/openshift-pipeline/pipelines-index-{4.14-4.18}:1.15
- Component images: 28 images in quay.io/openshift-pipeline/
- QE handoff: .planning/phases/03-dev-release/QE-HANDOFF.md

The bundle in this release was built from the release-v1.15.x branch before the Go 1.25 builder update (PR #14352). A new bundle with Go 1.25 images would need to be built for the stage release. However, the critical CVE fixes (jwt-go, x/crypto, oauth2) are included.

Phase 4 cannot proceed until ISS-006 is resolved. The Snyk SAST scanner needs to be configured to ignore the false positive findings.

<next_action>
1. Fix ISS-006 (Snyk false positives) — choose one approach:
   a. Add `#nosec G101` comments to upstream code (requires upstream PRs)
   b. Add exclusions to KFP known-false-positives repo (gitlab.cee.redhat.com/osh/known-false-positives)
   c. Use `IGNORE_FILE_PATHS` parameter in pipeline config

2. Once ISS-006 is fixed:
   - Trigger fresh bundle build with Go 1.25 images (optional but recommended)
   - Run /osp:stage-release to execute stage release
</next_action>
