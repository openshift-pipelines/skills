<current_state>
All Konflux nudge PRs merged. project.yaml has fresh digests for operator/proxy/webhook components. Ready to copy images to dev registry and test deployment.

Waiting on user to provide new cluster for deployment testing.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- PR #14352 (Go builder v1.25) merged at 13:41 UTC
- Webhook nudge merged (9b9b97d) at 13:54 UTC
- Operator nudge merged (5300134) at 13:57 UTC
- Proxy nudge merged (3ba1245) at 13:57 UTC
- project.yaml now has fresh digests:
  - operator: sha256:89f47cbea5b40774dceb4bfdd41d9152ef7ec5043e90868d5f1d8e68e4fb537a
  - proxy: sha256:2426d2f80f624ed47d80eeccaa9849d07f5228d4d2869c5f013438d18766cb29
  - webhook: sha256:99da95faf224eac323202d27bcaca4bf4f11247de44f71afd441c7ab4d79d23d
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
1. Copy fresh images to dev registry (quay.io/openshift-pipeline)
   - Option A: Just 3 updated components (operator, proxy, webhook)
   - Option B: All component images for consistency
2. Test deployment on new OCP cluster (user will provide)
3. Generate QE handoff document
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- ISS-006 (Snyk SAST false positives) deferred to after dev release - will fix before stage release (Phase 4)
- EC failures on PRs can be ignored - they're pre-existing false positives, not new issues
- Component nudge PRs update project.yaml directly (no separate bundle nudge needed)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None currently
- ISS-006 will block Phase 4 (Stage Release) but not dev release
</blockers>

<context>
The dev release workflow for 1.15.4 is nearly complete. All component images have been rebuilt with:
- Go 1.25 builder (required for upstream Go 1.25.0)
- Fresh CVE fixes (jwt-go, oauth2, x/crypto)

The next step is copying images from Konflux (quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/tekton-ecosystem-tenant/1-15/) to the dev registry (quay.io/openshift-pipeline/) so they can be tested on a cluster.

User mentioned they will provide a new cluster for deployment testing.
</context>

<next_action>
1. Ask user if new cluster is ready
2. Copy fresh component images to quay.io/openshift-pipeline:
   - Use skopeo copy with digest references
   - At minimum: operator, proxy, webhook
   - Optionally: all 31 component images for full refresh
3. Apply CatalogSource on cluster and test deployment
</next_action>
