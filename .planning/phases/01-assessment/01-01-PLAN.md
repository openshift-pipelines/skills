<objective>
Understand complete release state for OpenShift Pipelines 1.15.4 — all issues, CVEs, blockers, and component status.

Purpose: Establish baseline understanding of what needs to be fixed before the release can proceed. This assessment informs Phase 2 (Fix Blockers) planning.
Output: Comprehensive release status report, CVE analysis, component checklist, and prioritized action items.

**Jira Version:**
- URL: https://issues.redhat.com/projects/SRVKP/versions/12453355
- Version ID: 12453355
- Name: Pipelines 1.15.4

**Skills to Execute:**
- `/osp:release-status` - Fetches Jira issues, categorizes by status, generates summary
- `/osp:release-checklist` - Maps components, analyzes CVEs, generates checklist with action items

**Authentication Required:**
- Jira: `JIRA_TOKEN` env var or `~/.config/osp/config.json`
- GitHub: `gh` CLI authenticated (for PR status checks)

**Expected Outputs:**
1. Release status summary with issue counts by status
2. CVE analysis showing which are fixed vs need attention
3. Component-to-repo mapping with status
4. Blocking issues identification
5. TodoWrite action items for Phase 2
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Execute release-status skill for issue overview</name>
  <files>None (skill execution, generates report output)</files>
  <action>
Run `/osp:release-status` skill with Jira version 12453355.

This skill will:
1. Verify Jira authentication
2. Fetch version metadata from Jira API
3. Fetch all issues with pagination (may be >200 issues)
4. Categorize issues by status (Done, In Progress, Pending)
5. Search GitHub for related PRs on pending issues
6. Generate markdown summary report
7. Create TodoWrite items for pending work

**Input:** Jira version ID `12453355` (Pipelines 1.15.4)

**Do NOT:** Create manual API calls — let the skill handle the workflow.
  </action>
  <verify>
- Skill completes without authentication errors
- Issue count is retrieved (total, done, in progress, pending)
- Report includes status breakdown by issue type
- TodoWrite items created for non-closed issues
  </verify>
  <done>
- Release status report generated with accurate issue counts
- Pending issues identified with PR status
- Action items visible in todo list
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Execute release-checklist skill for detailed analysis</name>
  <files>None (skill execution, generates checklist output)</files>
  <action>
Run `/osp:release-checklist` skill with Jira version 12453355.

This skill will:
1. Fetch all issues and map to downstream components
2. Clone hack repo to get accurate branch configurations
3. Analyze open Vulnerability issues (CVEs):
   - Extract CVE details from summaries
   - Check current dependency versions in downstream repos
   - Look up CVE fix versions via web search
   - Determine fix status (FIXED vs NEEDS_FIX)
   - Check upstream for available fixes
4. Validate base images in Dockerfiles
5. Generate per-component checklist
6. Identify blocking issues
7. Create prioritized TodoWrite action items

**Input:** Jira version ID `12453355` (Pipelines 1.15.4)

**Critical output to capture:**
- CVE status table (which CVEs are fixed vs need fixing)
- Blocking issues list with recommended actions
- Component checklist showing what needs work
- Upstream cherry-pick recommendations for unfixed CVEs

**Do NOT:** Start fixing anything — this is assessment only.
  </action>
  <verify>
- CVE analysis table shows fix status for each vulnerability
- Component mapping completed (Jira component → downstream repo)
- Blocking issues clearly identified
- TodoWrite items include prioritized CVE fixes
- Base image validation completed (if applicable)
  </verify>
  <done>
- Full release checklist generated
- CVE status known for all Vulnerability issues
- Upstream fix availability determined for unfixed CVEs
- Phase 2 work scope is clear from the action items
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] Both skills executed successfully
- [ ] Release status report shows accurate issue breakdown
- [ ] CVE analysis identifies which need fixing and where fixes come from
- [ ] Component checklist maps all affected repos
- [ ] TodoWrite has prioritized action items for Phase 2
- [ ] No authentication errors encountered
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Both `/osp:release-status` and `/osp:release-checklist` completed
- Total issue count known (Closed, In Progress, Open)
- CVE fix status determined for all Vulnerability issues
- Blocking issues identified (CVEs, upstream deps, build issues)
- Upstream fix availability known for unfixed CVEs
- Action items created that inform Phase 2 planning
- Clear understanding of release readiness
</success_criteria>
