<current_state>
Phase 3.1 (Skill Refinement) is in progress. We're improving 6 OSP skills based on learnings from the 1.15.4 release.

Currently halfway through implementing the plan - 3 skills updated, 3 remaining.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Task 1: `help.md` - DONE
  - Added "Common Workflows" section after Quick Start
  - Added "Troubleshooting Quick Reference" table
  - Workflows: build failing, release progress, trigger rebuild, copy images

- Task 2: `release-status.md` - DONE
  - Added "Important: Jira-GitHub Sync Gap" section
  - Includes verification steps for CVE fix status
  - Documents 1.15.4 examples (SRVKP-7344, SRVKP-7201, SRVKP-7198)

- Task 3: `component-builds.md` - DONE
  - Added "Triggering Rebuilds (Critical Knowledge)" in execution_context
  - Added "Understanding 'no-runs' Status" explanation after status table
  - Documents CEL path filtering, Dockerfile comment trigger pattern
  - Added build order documentation (CORE → CLI → OPERATOR → INDEX)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Task 4: `konflux-image.md` - NOT STARTED
  - Add "Why Snapshots API is Authoritative" explanation
  - Add comprehensive error handling section (cookie expired, no snapshot, manifest unknown)

- Task 5: `configure.md` - NOT STARTED
  - Add prominent cookie expiration warning
  - Add cluster authentication section for `oc` CLI

- Task 6: `registry-info.md` - NOT STARTED
  - Add registry selection decision tree
  - Add 72-hour freshness warning
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Inserted as Phase 3.1 (decimal) to avoid renumbering existing phases
- Prioritized help.md first as entry point for discoverability
- Added concrete 1.15.4 examples to make learnings tangible
- CEL path filtering explanation is critical - users often try empty commits
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - straightforward documentation updates
</blockers>

<context>
This phase was inserted while Phase 4 (Stage Release) is blocked by ISS-006 (Snyk SAST false positives).

The goal is to encode domain knowledge from the 1.15.4 release into the skills so future releases benefit from accumulated experience. Key learnings:
- Snapshots API is authoritative (not PipelineRuns)
- Empty commits don't trigger Konflux (CEL path filtering)
- Jira-GitHub sync gap causes confusion
- SSO cookies expire after 8-24h
- 72-hour freshness threshold for release images

<next_action>
Start with: Read and update `konflux-image.md` to add Snapshots API rationale and error handling section. Then continue with `configure.md` and `registry-info.md`.
