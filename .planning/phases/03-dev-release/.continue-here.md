<current_state>
Created PR #14352 to update Go builder from v1.23 to v1.25. Waiting for Konflux PR pipeline to validate the build works with RHEL 8 runtime + Go 1.25 builder combination.

The upstream sync (PR #14238) was NOT a mistake — it correctly brought in Go 1.25.0 from upstream release-v0.71.x. The fix is to update the builder images, not revert.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Investigated PR #14238 upstream sync — confirmed it was intentional (update-sources workflow)
- Confirmed Go 1.25 builder (v1.25) exists and is used by release-v1.21.x
- Discovered release-v1.21.x uses RHEL 9 (ubi9), but 1.15.x must stay on RHEL 8 (ubi8)
- Closed revert PR #14351 (was wrong approach)
- Created PR #14352: Update Go builder v1.23 → v1.25 in all three Dockerfiles:
  - .konflux/dockerfiles/operator.Dockerfile
  - .konflux/dockerfiles/proxy.Dockerfile
  - .konflux/dockerfiles/webhook.Dockerfile
- Runtime base image unchanged (ubi8/ubi - RHEL 8)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
1. **Wait for PR #14352 Konflux pipeline** — validates Go 1.25 builder works with RHEL 8
2. If pipeline passes: Merge PR #14352
3. On-push pipeline will rebuild operator/proxy/webhook
4. Copy fresh images to dev registry (quay.io/openshift-pipeline)
5. Test deployment on OCP 4.18 cluster
6. Generate QE handoff
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- PR #14238 upstream sync was correct — 1.15.x tracks release-v0.71.x upstream
- Fix is to update builder images (v1.23 → v1.25), NOT revert the sync
- Keep RHEL 8 (ubi8) runtime — only update the Go builder
- Go produces mostly static binaries, so v1.25 builder should work with ubi8 runtime
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
**Waiting on Konflux PR pipeline for #14352**
- If it passes: merge and proceed
- If it fails: may need explicit el8 tag like `openshift-golang-builder:v1.25.x-xxxxx.el8`

Key insight from this session: The builder tag format supports RHEL variants:
`v1.23.9-202506111440.gdd3c620.el8` (el8 = RHEL 8, el9 = RHEL 9)

Using just `v1.25` may default to el9. If the PR pipeline fails, we'll need to find the specific el8 tag for v1.25.

Builder/runtime matrix discovered:
| Branch | Go Builder | Runtime |
|--------|------------|---------|
| 1.15.x | v1.23 | ubi8 (RHEL 8) |
| 1.17.x | v1.23 | ubi8 (RHEL 8) |
| 1.18.x | v1.23 | ubi9 (RHEL 9) |
| 1.20.x | v1.24 | ubi9 (RHEL 9) |
| 1.21.x | v1.25 | ubi9 (RHEL 9) |

1.15.x is the first to try v1.25 builder with ubi8 runtime.

<next_action>
1. Check PR #14352 pipeline status: `gh pr checks 14352 --repo openshift-pipelines/operator`
2. If passed: merge and monitor on-push builds
3. If failed: investigate logs, may need el8-specific builder tag
4. After builds pass: proceed with dev release (copy images, test deployment)
</next_action>
