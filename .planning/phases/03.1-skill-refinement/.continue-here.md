<current_state>
Phase 3.1 (Skill Refinement) is **COMPLETE**. All 6 OSP skills have been updated with domain knowledge from the 1.15.4 release.

Project is now at Phase 4 (Stage Release), which remains **BLOCKED** by ISS-006 (Snyk SAST false positives).
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**Session 2026-01-20:**
- Task 1: `help.md` - Added "Common Workflows" section, "Troubleshooting Quick Reference" table
- Task 2: `release-status.md` - Added "Jira-GitHub Sync Gap" section with verification steps
- Task 3: `component-builds.md` - Added CEL path filtering, rebuild triggers, build order docs

**Session 2026-01-21:**
- Task 4: `konflux-image.md` - Added "Why Snapshots API is Authoritative" section + comprehensive troubleshooting (5 error scenarios)
- Task 5: `configure.md` - Added cookie expiration warning at top + complete cluster authentication section
- Task 6: `registry-info.md` - Added 72-hour freshness rule + ASCII decision tree for registry selection
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
None for Phase 3.1 — phase is complete.

**Next phase:** Phase 4 (Stage Release) — BLOCKED by ISS-006
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Inserted as Phase 3.1 (decimal) to avoid renumbering existing phases
- Prioritized help.md first as entry point for discoverability
- Added concrete 1.15.4 examples to make learnings tangible
- CEL path filtering explanation is critical — users often try empty commits
- Snapshots API is authoritative over PipelineRuns (which get pruned)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- **ISS-006**: Snyk SAST false positives causing EC failures — Stage release blocker
  - Snyk flags Kubernetes Secret resource names as "hardcoded credentials"
  - Must be resolved before Phase 4 can proceed
  - See `.planning/ISSUES.md` for fix options
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 3.1 was inserted while Phase 4 (Stage Release) is blocked by ISS-006.

All skills now encode domain knowledge from the 1.15.4 release:
- Snapshots API is authoritative (not PipelineRuns)
- Empty commits don't trigger Konflux (CEL path filtering)
- SSO cookies expire after 8-24h
- 72-hour freshness threshold for release images
- Cluster auth is separate from Konflux auth

<next_action>
1. Check ISS-006 blocker status — is Snyk SAST issue resolved?
2. If resolved → proceed to Phase 4 (Stage Release)
3. If still blocked → wait or investigate workaround
